// it should be possible to just write the file you search for to search in the current directory
// also you should be able to search for paths like     C-Projects/search      or         C-Projects/search/

searching for Paths doesnt work properly
-> isLast or source variable

if functional make code "clean"
-> split searchFile logic
-> struct for parameters (look up the convention for that)
